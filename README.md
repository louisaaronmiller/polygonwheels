# polygonwheels
Cog: This contains 4 functions, 1: to Generate a gear, 2: To plot this gear as a still image, 3: to spin a single gear around a circles circumference, 4: multiple gears spinning to show gear pair in an envelope.
stillcog: A still image of a generated gear, using Cog's 1st and 2nd function.
SingleCogAni: A single cog animation obtained from Cog's 3rd function
Envelope: Created using Cog's 4th function, this is multiple gears spinning around a circumference
EnvelopeApprox: close up of Envelope animation to show that its an approximation
Envelope2: This shows another gear pair, where the traversed circle circumference's radius is reduced.

SquareWheels: A function that generates an animation of any polygon that draws its own perfect road
---> Each gif generated using this function has the format shape[number of sides of shape].gif
    - polygon300 -> approximately a circle
    - polygon4 -> square
    - polygon3 -> triangle
sqequation: this generates road functions for a plethora of polygons which increase in number of sides; shows that as number of sides increases it approximates a straight line
Only_path: instead of a shape animation, it just returns the path traversed.

Derivations 1: This establishes fundamental ideas used in the code for SquareWheels.
